drupal_contactfield
===================

Based on the Drupal 7 addressfield module, this module adds fields for phone number, extension, mobile, fax, and email address.

Unlike addressfield and addressfield_phone, the additional fields are stored in their own columns of the field table as opposed to serialized into a single data column.
